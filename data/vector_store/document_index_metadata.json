Numerous successful initiatives have been developed to broaden participation in computing, for example, by combining computing majors with disciplines in which there has traditionally been greater gender diversity [ 7]. However, this surge of interest is putting pressure on resources at many insti- tutions and causing concern amongst administrators and educators [46]. A particularly challenging aspect involves delivering on-the-spot assistance when students need help. Traditional approaches, such as running scheduled office",

Traditional approaches, such as running scheduled office hours in which students can approach instructors and teaching assistants, are often poorly utilized [ 56].arXiv:2401.11314v2 [cs.HC] 25 Feb 2024 CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Kazemitabaar, et al. Moreover, in-person support is not equitable as not all students feel comfortable seeking help from an instructor, and students who are bolder may receive help repeatedly while others wait [ 55]. There is an urgent need to develop more scalable, equitable and student- friendly solutions for providing support in programming courses. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) may of- fer one solution. LLM-powered AI tools such as ChatGPT [ 48] can act as powerful coding assistants that generate code from natural language descriptions. However, the rapid growth and pervasive- ness of LLMs have raised concerns about their use in educational settings [ 26]. This has led to some institutions banning access to tools like ChatGPT [ 24]. In computing education, in particular, con- cerns have been voiced regarding issues of academic integrity and student over-reliance [ 3,30]. Indeed, research has shown that LLMs can generate direct solutions to almost any problem typical in intro- ductory programming courses [ 12,16]. To develop pedagogically effective real-time support solutions for programming courses, it is necessary to implement suitable \"guardrails\" that restrict the",

This ensures students use the AI constructively [14]. In this paper, we present CodeAid, an LLM-powered coding assistant that is designed to meet the needs of both students and educators: being helpful and technically correct, while not directly revealing code solutions. We used an iterative design approach that involved frequent requirements elicitation and feedback from the course instructor, who taught the course in which CodeAid was deployed. CodeAid allowed students to (i) ask general programming questions, (ii) ask questions about the code they provide, (iii) explain the code they provide, (iv) help fix the code they provide, or (v) help write code. We deployed CodeAid in a large introductory C and Systems Programming course, spanning a 12-week semester, with about 700 university students. During the first half of the course, we analyzed usage data and provided weekly reports to the course instructor. Halfway through the course, we made several updates to the as- sistant based on this feedback. Overall, during the semester-long deployment, we collected data from multiple sources: (i) more than 8,000 interactions with CodeAid along with ratings from students for each generated response, (ii) ten weekly surveys about students’ usage of CodeAid in comparison with other learning resources, (iii) 22",

We then performed a thematic analysis on 2,100 randomly sampled usages of the system (includ- ing the questions that were asked, provided code, and generated responses). Lastly, we presented the results of our deployment to eight University-level programming course instructors from six countries and conducted semi-structured interviews with them to gain further insights into how such AI assistants may be adopted and integrated into new courses in the future. To effectively understand the implications of AI-powered tools in programming education, this paper is guided by the following research questions:•RQ1 - Usage Patterns: What patterns emerged in student usage of CodeAid, in terms of frequency, choice of features, usage patterns, and the nature of questions posed? •RQ2 - CodeAid Responses: How effective was CodeAid in producing technically correct and helpful responses without directly revealing coding solutions? •RQ3 - Student Perspectives: How did students perceive CodeAid and its comparative advantages over existing tools including ChatGPT? •RQ4 - Educator’s Perspectives: What are the perspec- tives of educators regarding learner-focused AI assistants",

By synthesizing answers to the above research questions, this paper presents a critical analysis of the broader design space for AI assistants like CodeAid in programming education. We draw on the experience of iteratively developing CodeAid and on the insights from its semester-long deployment to identify four major design considerations for tool design. We highlight the key trade-offs that need to be considered, and present a set of generalizable guidelines for the design of pedagogical LLM-powered coding assistants. 2 RELATED WORK The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), and their wide array of potential applications, has sparked enormous research interest [ 5] and have generated intense debate about the opportu- nities and challenges they present, especially in domains such as education [14, 26]. 2.1 LLMs in Computer Science Education As LLMs become more widely used in practice, education researchers are exploring the potential of LLMs to produce educational content, enhance student engagement and customize learning experiences [26]. This is especially true in computing education, given that code-generating tools are becoming widely adopted in industry practice. This has led to ongoing discussions about the need to change how computing is taught [",

Lau and Guo [ 30] interviewed 20 in- troductory programming instructors to understand how they plan to adapt their courses. The authors found that in the short term, many educators planned to discourage \"AI-assisted cheating\" by banning and increasing the weighting of invigilated exam scores, while others are more willing to embrace AI tools by integrating them into their classes. Recent work in the computer science education community has started to explore the implications and opportunities of LLMs on computer science learning from different perspectives [ 3]. Most of this recent work has focused on understanding the capabilities of LLMs for completing programming tasks [ 12] and on generating instructional content [ 34]. For example, Finnie-Ansley et al. [ 17] showed that Open AI Codex performs better than most students on code writing questions in both CS1 and CS2 exams. Similarly, Savelka et al. compared the capabilities of GPT-3 and GPT-4 on 599 programming exercises from three Python programming courses and found that the GPT models evolved from completely failing the typical programming class’ assessments (the original GPT-3) CodeAid: Design and Semester-Long Deployment of an LLM-based Programming Assistant CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA to passing the courses with no human involvement (GPT-4) [",

[53] analyzed the novelty, plausibility, and readiness of 120 pro- gramming exercises generated by OpenAI Codex and proposed the potential of using such models to come up with coding assignments. In contrast, we explore the use of LLMs to help students complete programming exercises without providing direct code solutions. 2.2 Question Answering Providing accurate and timely answers to student questions is im- portant for effective learning, however, this is a challenge for many computing educators given that class sizes are growing. Moreover, not all students feel equally comfortable approaching an instructor or teaching assistant for help, which can lead to inequity in comput- ing classrooms [ 18]. The prospect of providing LLM-based support for answering student questions is therefore of great interest to educators [ 29]. In recent work, Liffiton et al. describe initial work in this direction with their CodeHelp tool which provides assis- tance to programming students but employs guardrails to avoid directly revealing solutions [ 37]. Students using CodeHelp can en- ter a free-form question into a text area, along with code and an optional error message. They found that students using CodeHelp over a semester-long programming course (52 students) valued the on-demand availability of the tool, but",

In contrast, CodeAid offers a range of input templates and interactive response formats to cater to diverse student needs. Furthermore, whereas CodeHelp’s evaluation centered around student usage and perceptions, CodeAid delves deeper, assessing response quality through thematic analysis and broadening the evaluation scope by involving a larger student cohort (700 students) and gathering insights from course instructors. 2.3 Explaining Code Accurate explanations of code are useful for students learning pro- gramming, and can help them improve their reasoning when writ- ing their own code [ 45]. For example, ‘explain in plain English’ questions prompt students to explain their understanding of code at an abstract level [ 62], and provides both long-term and short-term learning benefits [ 45,59]. Modelling explanations created by ex- perts is an effective way for students to develop this important skill, however, generating high-quality explanations for a large quantity of varying code fragments represents a significant workload for instructors [39]. The generation of code explanations by LLMs is an active area of research. MacNeil et al. [ 39] reported student experience with LLM- generated code explanations in a web software development e-book. They showed that most students perceived the",

They showed that most students perceived the code explanations as helpful, but engagement depends on code length, code complexity and explanation types. Recent work by Leinonen et al. [ 33] showed that LLMs can generate code explanations that are more accurate and easier to understand than those created by students themselves, thus providing a potential scalable solution when compared to peer- generated approaches. CodeAid enhances this by allowing students to ask questions directly from their code to gain clarity on specificconcepts, while also offering an interactive feature for line-by-line code explanations. 2.4 Writing and Debugging Code The ability to write code has been a traditionally important learn- ing outcome for novices in introductory programming courses. A common approach for the development of code writing skills has been through the use of frequent programming practice with many small problems [ 1,13]. LLMs have shown themselves capable of solving introductory level programming problems with very high accuracy [ 16,52], and thus can provide direct support for code writing when students need help. The literature on debugging also has a long history, and various tools [ 21,22] and activities have been proposed to help novices and students learn debugging tech- niques [ 31,36,41,42]. Recent work has shown that LLMs have the potential to be used to assist in many aspects of debugging, including producing more",

CodeAid uses a similar, high-precision method for feedback generation, but also tries to improve the experience by visually annotating the erroneous sections of students’ code with suggestions for corrections. Kazemitabaar et al. developed Coding Steps to explore the use of LLM-based code generators for supporting learners in introductory programming [ 27]. Coding Steps incorporates a code generator into the user interface of an online programming tool. Students can generate code by providing a natural language prompt to the tool, which is then sent to the OpenAI Codex API, and the response is automatically pasted into the student’s code editor. They studied students using Coding Steps to solve a large set of Python program- ming tasks. One key finding was that students frequently copied the exercise questions as prompts and then used the AI-generated code without making any alterations to it. This reliance on the code generator is suggestive of the over-dependency problem [ 9–11]. To address this, CodeAid integrates guardrails to restrict the open- ended AI system from generating direct code solutions even if stu- dents ask for them. Additionally, it uses scaffolding techniques like interactive pseudo-code and code annotations to support students in",

CodeAid was designed based on prior literature, OpenAI API capabilities, in- structor consultations, and pilot studies. The platform has five main features: Help Write Code andHelp Fix Code for hands-on coding support, General Question andExplain Code for conceptual under- standing, and Question from Code as a versatile assistance covering both areas. Each feature was carefully designed to produce help- ful responses while not directly generating code solutions. In this section, we focus on CodeAid’s initial design and architecture. The system went through a major update based on midterm feedback during its deployment which is described later in Section 5. CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Kazemitabaar, et al.

The input section (Figure 1) features an input text box, a code input with syntax highlighting, and a radio button group to select from one of the features. A student first selects a feature, enters input (like a function-related ques- tion), and hits submit. CodeAid then displays the response using UI elements specific to the selected feature. A section on top of the main input area provided pop-up videos to explain each feature. We also displayed a disclaimer to make sure students understand that the responses are generated by an AI language model and it might generate responses with excessive confidence or be incorrect. 3.1 Primary CodeAid Assistance Features To control the output produced by the LLM and prevent displaying any code solutions to students, we employed few-shot learning as described in [ 8]. We provided input/output example pairs to define the overarching format of the LLM’s output. This enabled us to confine or restrict code generation, and to add interactive components to the response. This section introduces the design and behaviour of each of the main assistance features. 3.1.1 General Question.

The response, displayed in Figure 2a, was limited to natural language, although sometimes included inline code (such as a function prototype), but no multi-line code. 3.1.2 Inline Code Exploration. Inline Code Exploration In each of the primary five features, responses or explanations often contain C programming keywords (such as functions). To provide opportunities for learning, we displayed these keywords in a dif- ferent style. With this feature, students can hover over a keyword for further exploration: generate sample code about that keyword, generate documentation, or ask a question about the keyword. In- voking any of these three options, will generate an Inline Code Exploration response which is displayed in Figure 2e.3.1.3 Question from Code.

Help Fix Code To help students in their code debugging tasks, students could enter their buggy code in the code editor and the intended behaviour or the problem of the code in the question input (which displayed \"Intended Behavior\" as its title when this feature was selected). The initial version of the Help Fix Code feature (Figure 2d) performed two tasks in the backend: first, it attempted to generate the correct version of the provided code based on the given description, and second, it tried to explain using bullet points what was changed and why (see Figure 3b for more details). The response interface (Figure 2d) only displayed the bullet points and not the fixed code as a way to not reveal direct code solutions. 3.1.5 Explain Code. Explain Code To help students in use cases such as understanding starter code used in assignments or code taught during lectures, we designed the Explain Code feature (Figure 2c). Upon selecting this feature, the code editor would be enabled and students could paste in code they wanted to be explained. The generated output was an interface that displayed the users’ code and enabled them to hover over each line to see the detailed ex- planation for that line and how the line works in orchestration with the rest of the code. To do this, we used a few-shot learning approach and conditioned the model to produce a simple",

The server is implemented using Node.js , specifi- cally: Express.js for REST API used in client-server communication, Mongoose to interact with a cloud-based instance of MongoDB for storing user data and generated responses, Passport.js for user au- thentication, Socket.io for streaming data from OpenAI into the backend (to be stored in the database) and parsed for the client to be displayed in the UI. The client-side code was developed using theReact Framework . For user input, we included a textbox and an instance of the Monaco Editor that provided syntax highlighting for C program- ming. These two inputs were selectively enabled or disabled basedon the selected feature to indicate which one the user needs to fill in. After users entered the required text for a question and clicked on the generate button, the LLM started streaming output to the backend. The backend simultaneously parsed the response and streamed it to the client. Once the stream finished (e.g. after reach- ing a specified stop token in the stream), the backend stored the entire response in the database and signalled the client about the finished stream.

We carefully designed prompts to ensure responses (i) follow structured, and easy-to-parse templates, (ii) are technically correct, and (iii) use a style, tone, and level of technicality that is both helpful and not overwhelming for students. For example, in CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Kazemitabaar, et al.

This significantly improved suggestion quality and accuracy. Similarly, in the updated system, we adopted a pseudo-code style that balances between not overly revealing the code’s syntax and not being too close to natural language, which might be too long and overwhelming. Furthermore, the initial sys- tem used the code-davinci-002 GPT-3 model, but was updated to the gpt-3.5-turbo GPT-3.5 model in the updated system.

All students had optional access to CodeAid as an additional resource throughout the semester. Our study, which included the use of an AI tool, interviews, and weekly surveys, was approved by our institute’s ethics review board prior to deployment. 4.1 Course Structure The second-year course focused heavily on C programming, and in- cluded topics such as shell programming, file processing, processes, signals, system calls, and basic network programming. Prerequi- sites of the course include a software design course taught in Java and introductory programming using Python. To accommodate the large 700-student class, the course was split into four lectures segments. Students were required to watch specific videos and complete weekly preparation exercises by a set deadline before each lecture. The course included ten lab exercises (worth 1% each), four programming assignments (A1 to A4, worth 39% in total), amidterm test (worth 10%), and a final exam (worth 40%).

Course policies allowed the use of CodeAid, but explicitly forbade the use of other AI tools (such as ChatGPT) to complete any coursework. Students were also asked to cite any external sources that they used for their work. Students in the course had access to a variety of resources beyond CodeAid: recorded lecture videos, lecture notes, an online Q&A discussion board moderated by the instructors, and weekly office hours with teaching assistants and course instructors. 4.2 Deployment and Participants To ensure ethical integrity and avoid any perceived pressure, stu- dents’ engagement with CodeAid, weekly surveys, and interviews in our study was entirely voluntary and confidential from course in- structors. The researchers informed the instructors only at the end of the semester about who had completed the surveys, which con- tributed 1% to the course mark, without revealing the participants’ consent status. Students’ consent was obtained through the first weekly survey, where they selected from three options: consent to share their CodeAid data for research, participate in surveys for the grade without data sharing, or opt out of surveys, foregoing a potential 1% grade increase. Out of all, 563 (80%) students",

A primary data source for understanding students’ usage patterns (RQ1) and the assis- tant’s response quality (RQ2), was CodeAid’s activity logs. Log data has become an important data source to understand programming experiences [ 6] and coding approaches [ 17,25], particularly when interacting with LLMs [ 27,28]. For each question asked by students, we closely examined its content and CodeAid’s generated responses through a thematic analysis described later in this section. To",

To better understand the usefulness of the AI-generated responses (RQ2), CodeAid prompted students with a mandatory question that asked \"How useful was this response?\" . Students had to respond to a 5- point Likert scale (displayed as a rating stars) and optionally type a reason for their rating before they could use the system again. For each feature, we analyzed the ratings and grouped the reasons into positive and negative feedback to better understand students’ perceptions. 4.3.2 Weekly Research Surveys. To understand how students used CodeAid in comparison to traditional educational resources and ChatGPT (RQ3), we conducted a weekly online survey. These types of surveys have aided researchers in monitoring students’ percep- tions towards AI agents [ 61]. Similarly, we asked students to report their comparative usage of multiple resources including lecture videos, lecture notes, Q&A discussion boards, office hours, and CodeAid. We also asked questions about why they did or did not use CodeAid, how useful they found it, what they liked or disliked about the tool, and any open-ended feedback about CodeAid during the last week of the course.4.3.3 Semi-structured Interviews with Students.

Eight interviews were conducted halfway through the course (after students had used CodeAid for A1 and A2), and 14 interviews were done after the course was finished (after their final exams). After obtaining informed consent, our in- terview questions addressed productivity enhancement, shifts in workflow, verifying responses and reliability, usability concerns, learning moments with CodeAid, and contrasts with alternative resources like StackOverflow, a moderated Q&A discussion board, and other websites. We concluded the interviews with a short co- design activity, involving students as collaborators in envisioning and shaping future iterations of CodeAid. This approach effectively gathered their unique ideas and suggestions for features tailored to educational settings. Each interview lasted approximately an hour and every participant was compensated with a $25 gift card. 4.3.4 Post-Course Anonymous Survey. Since course policy prohib- ited the use of code generated from AI tools like ChatGPT to com- plete any course work, we conducted an anonymous survey to determine whether and why students used ChatGPT. Our goal was to gain a holistic view of students’ perceptions of AI assistants in large classes (RQ3). The survey further explored the frequency of their engagement with ChatGPT in comparison to CodeAid. 4.4 Thematic Analysis To gain deeper insights into how students interacted with",

From a total of 8132 usages, we initially removed those from students who did not agree to partici- pate in the research, leaving 7003 data points. We then randomly sampled 2100 data points (30%) and then removed usages that were unrelated to the course (n=71) were excessively long (n=133), or in which CodeAid encountered a technical error (n=82). We were then left with 1750 (25%) usages, on which we performed the thematic analysis and report our results. We created two high-level code dimensions to answer our re- search questions: (i) to understand usage patterns, choice of features, and the nature of questions posed (RQ1), we focused on the User CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Kazemitabaar, et al. Query (including any provided code or error logs), and (ii) to eval- uate the quality of the AI-generated responses (RQ2), we focused on the CodeAid Response . This enabled us to focus on relevant data for each of the sub-dimensions in our thematic analysis in the following rounds of analysis [4]. Under each of the two dimensions, we applied an inductive ap- proach where two researchers read through 100 randomly sampled data points together and allowed codes to emerge during the process [4].

The two researchers then independently coded another 120 randomly sampled data points using the initial codebook. Next, they discussed the results from the initial coding, resolved conflicts, and further refined the codebook. During this step, they presented the codes and representative usages to the course instructor and incorporated their feedback. To enhance the generalizability and reliability of our findings, we streamlined our coding definitions. For instance, responses with minor inaccuracies were labelled as \"incorrect\" . Similarly, if responses that were categorized as \"correct\" failed to adequately address the query, were irrelevant, repetitive, or exceeded the scope of the course material, they were labelled as \"unhelpful\" . After refining the codebook 1, the two researchers independently coded 200 data points and used Cohen’s Kappa and percentage agreement [ 43,47] to compute the inter-rater reliability for each of the sub-dimensions. After removing low-quality sub-dimensions, addressing disagreements, and finalizing the codebook, the two researchers independently coded a total of 1430 additional data points selected at random from the remaining untagged data.

This feedback was used to derive any needed iterations to the design of the tool. The feedback highlighted numerous aspects of CodeAid that students appreciated: clear explanations of code or complex top- ics, assistance in identifying errors, constant availability, direct and personalized engagement compared to online searches and documentation, and the flexibility to ask diverse questions. How- ever, our analysis also pinpointed several areas where CodeAid could be improved. Specifically, students felt that the responses they received were often too brief and lacked in-depth informa- tion, example usage code, or associated documentation. There were also concerns about incorrect answers or misleading suggestions for fixing their code. Another common frustration was the slow response time of the platform. Students pointed out the importance of the \"Help Fix Code\" feature, but suggested that it should provide specific line numbers where errors were detected. Furthermore, students expressed the need to ask follow-up questions beyond the \"General Question\" feature. Lastly, during the co-design phase of our interviews, students emphasized the need for seamless access to documentation for functions mentioned in CodeAid’s",

As a way to provide more com- prehensive responses and to increase engagement, we decided to add pseudo-code generation to most of the features (Figure 4b). We used pseudo-code as a form of scaffolding, offering a simpli- fied and structured outline of a program, which serves as a bridge to actual coding without directly revealing the code itself [ 32]. To enable this functionality, we updated our LLM prompts for all features to ask the model to generate code. However, instead of showing this code to the user, we sent it to a new LLM function that generated the pseudo-code. For line-by-line explanations, the new LLM function also included an explanation following each line in the form: [pseudo-code] /// description of details . This was then parsed and only the pseudo-code was rendered, while the explanation would be displayed whenever the user hovers over that particular line. 5.1.2 Displaying Function Documentation. Since the Inline Code Exploration was underutilized, we removed it and instead updated all of the features to display static (non-AI generated) documenta- tion for functions that were relevant to the query. Students could",

      "text": "(non-AI generated) documenta- tion for functions that were relevant to the query. Students could hover over the function buttons to see the detailed documentation with usage descriptions and code examples (Figure 4d). We imple- mented this by asking the LLM to always list all relevant functions to the user’s query. To retrieve the documentation for each function, we developed a local key-value database in which the keys were function names and values were the documentation objects scraped from the Standard C Library parsed into a JSON object. 5.1.3 Stream Generation. To address concerns over response de- lays, we incorporated OpenAI’s stream generation mechanism for CodeAid’s responses to provide immediate feedback. To achieve this, we developed a specific markup for each of the features to enable parsing the partially generated response as it was being streamed. This enabled our system to immediately start displaying responses after users clicked the generate button. For single-line components such as generating a short summary for the provided code, or responding with a single-line answer to an asked question, our markup used the following format: [output-name]: <text> . For multi-line components such as code parts, we used two to- kens, [start-of-part] and [end-of-part] . Furthermore, in situ- ations where the output of one LLM function was sent to another LLM function in series (e.g. to generate the final pseudo-code from code), our API did not show the generated code,",

We improved the Gen- eral Question and Question from Code features to provide more detailed and thorough answers by refining the few-shot prompt- ing examples. To enhance the overall quality, accuracy, and reli- ability of CodeAid’s responses, we upgraded the AI model from code-davinci-002 to the more advanced gpt-3.5-turbo model.

We also updated the prompts to not respond to questions that were not relevant to C programming. 5.1.5 Redesigned Help Fix Code. We redesigned the feature based on feedback so that it would highlight the specific lines that require modifications, deletions, or additions. To achieve this, we used a data flow which is displayed in Figure 5. (1) Pre-processing: The buggy code is stripped of any comments and is then reformatted with a standard style.

(3) Matching Lines: A simple static code analyzer matches each line of the fixed code to the original buggy code. (4) Annotating Buggy Code: The buggy code is then annotated with three labels: /// [changed] , /// [removed] , or a new empty line with /// [added] .

Eventually, the explained changes and annotated code is streamed to the client for rendering and displaying the highlighted lines and on-hover interactions as displayed in Figure 4a. 5.1.6 Improved Follow-Up Questions. We redesigned the prompts to add the capability for users to ask follow-up questions in the Question from Code ,Explain Code , and Help Write Code features, thus improving the steering experience. Additionally, we integrated suggested follow-up prompts (Figure 4c), inspired by the \"did you mean X instead?\" suggestions commonly seen in search engines. 6 RESULTS In this section, we answer the first three research questions based on the overall usage of CodeAid throughout the entire semester.

Students, on average, inquired CodeAid 23.3 times (SD=41.2), spanning a range from 1 to a maximum of 333 questions per student. The majority of students (n=159) asked between 1 and 9 questions, followed by 80 students who asked 10 to 29 questions, 28 students who asked 30 to 49 questions, and 34 students who asked more than 50 questions. Student engagement surged approaching major assignment deadlines or exams (Figure 6b). The dataset of queries from consented students is available as supplementary material with this paper, offering a valuable resource for those interested in advancing AI educational tools. We analyzed the usage of CodeAid among different gender groups, particularly the predominant self-reported gender cate- gories. On average, those identifying as women used CodeAid 33.8 times, which was significantly more than those identifying as men,with an average usage of 18.4 times ( p=.004, d=.34, using an inde- pendent samples t-test).

For code and conceptual clarification , students mostly used the General Question feature (n=323), inquiring conceptual in- formation about syntax, pointers, string operations, data structures, input/output operations, system calls, shell programming, and com- pilation tools. The Question from Code feature was also used (n=124) to understand or clarify the role,behaviour , and details of particular parts in their provided code snippets. For function-specific queries , students mostly used the General Question feature, seeking insights into a specific function’s usage, behaviour, arguments, and return types.

Similarly, they used the General Question (n=16) but for smaller contexts (e.g., one line of codes, or shell programming commands), or by mistake (e.g., for- getting to include their code by not using Question from Code ). The most common type of inquiry here was to understand functional inconsistencies such as unexpected outputs, behaviours, warnings, and specific error messages.

The assistant succeeded in avoiding the display of direct code solutions. In response to 43% of queries, CodeAid produced purely natural language answers which included conceptual explanations. For 24% of queries, it produced pseudo-code, of which 16% were high-level and generic example codes, while 6% were the pseudo-code that implemented a specific behavior. These specific pseudo-codes, although indirect, might have revealed the high-level ideas about implementing a particular behavior that was required in an assignment. Furthermore, when debugging code using CodeAid, it never displayed the fixed code and only recommended suggestions to fix minor syntax errors (16%) and semantic issues (8%). Similarly, the Help Fix Code never gener- ated any code. However, the initial version of General Question and Question from Code produced generic, high-level example code in 104 instances (6%) which did not directly implement any part of assignments and were similar to what students can find on websites like Stack Overflow. Finally, in 37 instances (2%) these two features generated a short code solution (1-3 lines) to a specific behavior. 6.2.3 General Question.

Reasons associated with highly rated responses tended to report that the response was \"correct\" ,\"helpful\" ,\"concise\" , and \"clear\" , as evidenced by comments like \"explained my misunderstand- ing perfectly\" . Conversely, when giving negative ratings, students tended to report that they were due to (i) incomplete or superfi- cial explanations, (ii) the absence of example code, (iii) irrelevant or unclear responses, or (iv) incorrect or misleading information especially with more complex requests. 6.2.4 Question from Code.

However, they also reported challenges for more complex coding tasks introduced at the end of the course. One participant (S21) reported CodeAid became \"more difficult to use for longer codes\" and could not understand the \"interactions between multiple files. \" 6.2.6 Explain Code. From the thematic analysis of 95 randomly sampled Explain Code usages, we discovered that 95% (90 out of 95) of the explanations were accurate and perceived beneficial when they were correct.

Many students appreciated CodeAid’s 24/7 availability, with one noting, \"I like that it’s always there if I need any help. \" They highlighted the private space it offers where they can \"ask a lot of questions\" without \"having to talk to a human who will judge\" them. Students highlighted CodeAid’s role as a crucial supplementary resource to assist with coding tasks, with a student commenting, \"It helped me solve issues with my code that I wouldn’t have been able to figure out on my own. \" 6.3.2 Contextual Assistance. Students appreciated CodeAid’s abil- ity to provide \"faster access to relevant knowledge\" by offering con- textually relevant assistance and \"specific solutions\" that are \"more concise.\" They compared CodeAid to search",

Some students expressed that CodeAid has deepened their understanding, noting it \"explains things more deeply for someone who is trying to learn\" (S9) and of- fers\"a new way to learn code.\" However, some students preferred indirect responses to enable deeper engagement: \"I would like a hint rather than the answer. \" Although some students like S14 felt that they \"over-relied on it too much rather than thinking\" , many students displayed signs of self-regulation. They \"never tried to get the system to show the solution\" (S2), \"did not use the fix code feature\" (S4), or \"ask[ed] too general questions\" (S7) so they could learn. 6.3.4 Trust and Reliability. Many students recognized CodeAid’s utility, comparing its accuracy to Teaching Assistants: \"80% accu- rate",

      "text": "recognized CodeAid’s utility, comparing its accuracy to Teaching Assistants: \"80% accu- rate answers, similar to TA.\" Students acknowledged the utility of CodeAid’s assistance in specific contexts, finding it more accurate on simple questions. Some pointed out CodeAid’s confident tone when producing wrong answers, as noted by a student: \"it can lie CodeAid: Design and Semester-Long Deployment of an LLM-based Programming Assistant CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA to you, and still sound confident.\" In terms of trust, some found it superior, noting it seemed \"like a person who knows everything,\" while others expressed that they \"don’t trust a computer to give [them] accurate responses. \" Of interest, S13 noted that they trusted CodeAid more than Google, \"just because it was part of the course\" and endorsed by the instructor. 6.3.5 Reasons for Not Using CodeAid. Several themes emerged when students explained instances when they did not use CodeAid. The primary reason was a perceived \"lack of need, \" as many found existing course materials \"sufficient\" or the coursework easy. Some were either unaware of CodeAid or forgot to use it. Students also cited a preference for existing resources like GDB debugger, Stack Overflow, and Q&A discussion boards. A few favoured ChatGPT’s GPT-4 version for its ease and versatility. Personal desire for self- reliance was also a reason, with statements like \"I enjoy finding solutions by myself\" . Skepticism towards AI-generated content",

Some stu- dents preferred to consult friends, and several students mentioned the mandatory feedback as a reason for not using CodeAid. 6.3.6 Comparing CodeAid with ChatGPT. We conducted a fully anonymous post-course survey to ask students about their usage of ChatGPT during the course, despite the course policy to avoid its use. Of the 200 respondents, 23% exclusively used CodeAid, 38% used both CodeAid and ChatGPT, and 19% only used ChatGPT. The number of students who used ChatGPT \"sometimes,\" \"often,\" or\"a lot\" was 90, compared to 66 students for CodeAid. Among the reasons for not using ChatGPT were satisfaction with existing resources, concerns over academic integrity, and doubts about its reliability. Comparatively, students appreciated ChatGPT’s user- friendly interface, greater character limit, and free-form editing. They found it useful for handling complex inputs with \"multiple parts\" and\"using any format\" . ChatGPT was favoured for offering in-depth code reviews, generating more comprehensive answers, and producing code examples. When it came to learning about C programming concepts, students who used both tools reported a higher learning experience with ChatGPT. However, some students that used ChatGPT expressed that the direct solutions generated by ChatGPT was \"not good for learning\" (S10) or that \"ChatGPT",

Similarly, S21, \"I don’t think that I’m learning as much as spending time to fix [the code] myself.\" Conversely, students felt that they learn more using CodeAid \"since it’s targeted towards CS students and explanations are more technical and they do make you think\" . 6.3.7 Future Integration of AI Coding Tools. Most students reported that they will continue using AI coding tools, expressing that AI helps them \"work more efficiently, \" and understand coding concepts in a summarized way. Several envisioned using AI to \"create the skeleton code\" of their projects, \"optimize [their] code, \" and handle the \"tedious programming tasks that are not too complicated\" for them. Others wished to have these tools integrated into their coding environment. One student was eager to take \"a class about writing prompts to get more accurate answers.\" However, some students did not want to integrate AI coding tools in the near future. One mentioned limitations such as not being effective in debugging \"without seeing the entire program, \" and another student mentionedthat AI should not be used for learning due to its \"confident but incorrect answers\" and\"that it does not encourage learning. \" Lastly, a student highlighted the essence of learning as \"figuring things out on your own by googling, manually fixing bugs, looking at tutorials, etc. \" 7 EDUCATOR INTERVIEWS",

Educators were from six countries, including Germany (T6), India (T1), Jordan (T3), New Zealand (T2), the Netherlands (T8), and the USA (T4, T5, T7). These educators were actively engaged in teaching undergraduate- level programming courses. Six of them (T1, T3, and T5-T8) had over ten years of teaching experience, one had 5-10 years (T2), and another had 3 years (T4). Most were also engaged in computer science education (CSEd) research. The interviews began by ex- ploring the educators’ backgrounds and their current challenges and strategies, especially around students’ utilization of LLM-based coding tools like ChatGPT and Github Copilot. Subsequently, we introduced our pedagogical AI coding assistant, discussing its capa- bilities and insights gathered from our semester-long deployment as summarized in Section 6. The conversation then shifted to the educators’ opinions on our tool: what they liked and disliked, their pedagogical and ethical considerations regarding its use, their inter- est and requirements for integrating it into their courses, and how they perceived it relative to tools like ChatGPT.

While T5 didn’t see ChatGPT as a significant issue for advanced Computer Science courses, there was a general agreement about its potential threat to introductory programming classes. Notably, T1 mentioned \"I would encourage students to use a tool that respects that there’s a learner at the other end, not ChatGPT\" . 7.1.1 General Impressions. Educators generally held favourable impressions of CodeAid. T3 emphasized CodeAid’s pedagogical approach, stating that it offered an \"honest way of using ChatGPT, \" , particularly for students keen on academic integrity. Similarly, T4 mentioned that CodeAid was \"the most sensible path\" and a safer alternative to \"a completely unsafe and unmoderated\" tool like Chat- GPT. Similarly, T5 compared CodeAid to an \"excellent TA\" that prompts students to think critically rather than offering direct an- swers. Furthermore, T2 envisioned that CodeAid can greatly assist students in a flipped classroom setting, help students arrive at class more prepared, offer moments for self-reflection on lecture material, and support them in tackling assignments. 7.1.2 Perceptions on Pseudo-Code Usage.

T4 expressed that \"hiding the syntax\" helps with students’ meta-cognitive skills. From an ethical standpoint, T1 claimed that showing pseudo-code was even \"better than Google\" for certain queries, as opposed to viewing \"precise solutions available on Stack Overflow\" . However, T3 expressed slight concerns, particularly for upper-level courses, where revealing the algorithm via pseudo-code would be detrimental. 7.1.3 Concerns about Incorrect Responses and Misuses. Despite positive impressions, educators expressed various concerns. After viewing the results from our thematic analysis, T1 pointed out the risk of incorrect responses, especially for students whose fun- damentals are poor. T3 raised concerns about students \"trusting whatever the AI says\" . T1 suggested that these tools should \"build up students’ ability to critique\" LLM-generated responses. As a solution, T1 and T3 suggested including mandatory tutorials with quizzes before students can use CodeAid. T5 asked for more transparency by having CodeAid display recent incorrect responses for each of the features. T3 mentioned that the inaccuracies of",

T3 mentioned that the inaccuracies of the Help Fix Code feature could mislead students by highlighting incorrect lines, and suggested the feature could instead highlight potentially in- correct lines and ask self-reflective questions from students like \"Are you sure this line is doing [X]?\" . Additionally, T1, T4, T6, and T7 voiced worries about misusing or abusing CodeAid through repetitive queries and suggested throttling usage as a potential solution. 7.1.4 Keeping Students from Switching to ChatGPT. Many educa- tors felt that CodeAid should be designed in a way to keep students from switching to ChatGPT which \"was just a click away\" . T7 men- tioned that \"I can’t prevent students from using ChatGPT, but if I can get more students to use this tool instead of ChatGPT, then that’s better\" . As a way to attract students, T2 suggested \"creating an all-encompassing tool\" . Similarly, T7 and T8 suggested including a complete code editor with code execution capabilities to make it easier for students to remain engaged with CodeAid rather than defaulting to ChatGPT. Another recurring suggestion was revealing code solutions after multiple failed attempts to prevent frustration. For example, T1, T2, and T5 proposed gamifying the experience such as\"showing code could cost them some kind of points in the system\" or T7 mentioned to \"lock the system\" after showing code, asking the student to do something useful like",

How- ever, T3 strongly favoured CodeAid’s pedagogical approach and did not want CodeAid to reveal code solutions, asserting that \"if a TA is controlled to answer in an appropriate way and not show the solution, then this tool should also be controlled\" . When discussing the ability to customize CodeAid’s responses during a course, T4 was confronted with the dilemma that if they turned off a feature, then students might default to ChatGPT. 7.1.5 Pedagogical Customization. A recurrent theme centred on the importance of customization by instructors. Both T3 and T4 emphasized the need for instructors to have control over the types of responses generated by CodeAid for different types of questions. Specifically, T3 wanted CodeAid to produce pseudo-code only for implementation questions, and to merely offer hints for problem- solving questions. On the other hand, T4 wanted to control when pseudo-code was displayed and only enable it at the beginning ofthe course. T7 wanted to update CodeAid with a list of topics that have been taught in class so that it would not use other complex topics and functions when responding to students’ queries. 7.1.6 Student Monitoring Dashboard. Another prevalent theme was the need for instructor dashboards that monitor student in- teractions and track their queries. T2 highlighted that by tracking students, we can see what type of",

This data could help educators in identifying gaps in their instruction, as evidenced by frequently asked questions. Such insights might prompt them to \"step in and provide better examples\" . However, this monitoring comes with its own set of challenges. While T6 suggested aggre- gated data could provide feedback, accessing individual data might be restricted due to regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This poses a question on the balance between personalization and privacy. Lastly, T8 mentioned a crucial point concerning student anonymity and comfort. While recognizing the potential pedagogical benefits of understanding student queries, she mentioned \"Students should not feel like someone is watching them and they should feel the liberty to ask anything\" . 8 BEYOND CODEAID: IMPLICATIONS FOR PEDAGOGICAL LLM-POWERED CODING ASSISTANTS The iterative development of CodeAid and insights gained from its semester-long deployment enable us to propose design implications for the broader design of AI assistants in educational contexts. We position these implications within four main stages of a student’s help-seeking process with an AI assistant: 1) The decision to use the AI tool; 2) The formulation of a query; 3) The nature of response that is supplied; and 4) Actions needed once a response is",

Our results point to four high-level design considerations, for each of these stages, each with unique usability and educational trade-offs: •D1: Exploiting Unique Advantages of AI. For deciding when to use the tool, what is the role and unique advantages of an AI assistant compared to other available resources within the learning ecosystem? •D2: Designing the AI Querying Interface . What are the UI considerations for an AI assistant to allow users to formulate queries/prompts in a way that balances user-friendliness with meta-cognitive engagement? •D3: Balancing the Directness of AI Responses. How di- rect should the AI assistant’s responses be, so that it balances directness and learning engagement, and who should control this balance? •D4: Supporting Trust, Transparency and Control. Once a response from an AI assistant is received, what UI consid- erations are needed to ensure accuracy, trust, transparency, and control? 8.1 D1: Exploiting Unique Advantages of AI An initial stage of the help-seeking process is deciding what learn- ing resource to use within the learning material ecosystem that may be available to them. This leads to the first major design con- sideration of an AI coding assistant (Figure 7, D1): determining CodeAid: Design and Semester-Long Deployment of an LLM-based Programming Assistant CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Figure 7: Emerging",

More specific to CodeAid, students pinpointed unique advantages such as its stimulation of critical thinking (using pseudo-code), technical focus on C programming (relevant to their course), and its capability to \"pull\" comprehensive documentation related to queries. Similar features should be built within future tools. Considering the rapidly expanding ecosystem of productivity- focused AI tools, it is challenging to keep students in a learner- centric AI tool. To address this issue, our results suggest designing course-specific AI assistants, for example using approaches such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to allow specific contextual information to be included in model responses [ 35]. These assistants should be capable of (a) generating accurate, technically correct, and informative",

Furthermore, with access to the curriculum, the AI assistants’ responses will align more closely with students’ zone of proximal development [ 60], making them more relevant and beneficial for the students. Fu- ture tools can also direct students to content on the web such as relevant StackOverflow posts, similar to Bing Chat, and relevant documentation as illustrated in CodeAid, as well as providing ac- cess to instructor-verified practice exercises and sub-goal-labeled worked examples [40]. 8.2 D2: Designing the AI Querying Interface Once a user has chosen to use an AI coding assistant, the next main stage will be to enter their query. In CodeAid this is done througha structured user interface, whereas in ChatGPT, users enter free- form input. In any future system, another major design considera- tion is how the querying interface should be designed, such that it balances user-friendliness with meta-cognitive engagement (Figure 7, D2). Some students in our study preferred the simplicity and free- form nature of ChatGPT, while educators appreciated CodeAid’s structured design, and found that it promoted active engagement, critical thinking, and thoughtful inquiry. For instance, designers should decide (a)",

For instance, designers should decide (a) whether the assistant automatically gathers context (like a plugin in an IDE) or requires manual input from the user, (b) whether the assistant allows stu- dents to ask questions in a free-form manner, similar to interaction with popular chat-based AI models, or requires input in a specific structure and format, and (c) the assistant’s level of reactivity versus proactivity in identifying problems and facilitating help-seeking. The trade-off to consider is that automatic context integration, free- form input methods, and proactive assistance may enhance usability and ease of use, but could potentially reduce opportunities for stu- dents to engage in meta-cognitive activities – such as self-reflection and asking well-formed questions that promote critical thinking – which are essential for success in learning programming [ 50]. Future research is also needed to evaluate the impact of proactive problem identification and assistance, focusing on the design of minimally distracting assistants. Indeed, recent work by Prather et al. revealed that students did not like being shown suggestions when they felt they did not need the help [51]. 8.3 D3: Balancing the Directness of AI Responses After formulating the question, the degree of control over the type and directness of the assistance is the next design consideration (Figure 7, D3).

Students in our study exhibited varying needs: some sought explicit example code, others preferred subtle hints, and there were instances where they simply wanted the AI to provide direct solutions. Furthermore, educators highlighted the importance of customization options, allowing them to tailor the AI’s level of assistance, such as restricting the display of pseudo-code for specific queries or during certain course segments, to better align with pedagogical goals. This introduces an important trade-off: finding the right balance between sufficient scaffolding for critical learning and minimizing frustration, while also considering the degree of autonomy learners should have in personalizing their level of scaffolding. If the assistant is too direct and students have high autonomy over selecting their desired level of scaffolding, students might miss out on critical learning opportunities tailored to their zone of proximal development. This might negatively impact skill devel- opment and self-efficacy. Conversely, indirect responses can risk discouraging students if they feel overwhelmed, unsupported, and not making progress.

To promote deeper cognitive engagement and ensure progress, future tools might, as a last resort, display generated code but lock the AI tool until students complete a specific learning activity. This could involve the AI assistant highlighting critical sections of the code and prompting students to answer comprehension questions about these parts. Additionally, future AI tools could foster independent problem-solving using the Socratic Method [57] and transforming code generation requests into a series of problem- solving questions. With each correct response, the tool would reveal the code segment corresponding to that question. Furthermore, since code examples are a crucial learning resource [38], future AI assistants can differentiate between example code and direct solutions. Our thematic analysis revealed that a major- ity of queries were asking for code and conceptual clarifications, function-specification queries, error message interpretation, and high-level coding guidance. Consequently, future tools could be designed to display example code in response to queries not directly related to course assessments. 8.4 D4: Supporting Trust, Transparency and Control Upon receiving a response from the AI assistant, users must eval- uate its accuracy and helpfulness, and if necessary, provide more information to steer the AI towards a more suitable answer.

However, these challenges are compounded in educational AI assistants, which, like CodeAid, may be designed to provide scaf- folded, indirect responses without directly revealing solutions. Our thematic analysis showed how CodeAid’s responses were some- times incorrect or unhelpful. As such, students seeking to verify CodeAid’s responses often had to write and test a small program based on the provided suggestions. In contrast, students using a tool that provides direct responses, such as ChatGPT, could im- mediately access and run the generated code for verification. Any unpredictability within a learning context could erode trust in an AI coding assistant.This points to a fourth design consideration (Figure 7, D4): given the indirect nature of responses in educational AI assistants, how can we maximize user experience, efficiency, and predictability of obtaining a helpful response. This could involve displaying the AI’s assumptions on input queries, engaging students in verifying them, and enabling feedback mechanisms to ensure high-quality responses. While such techniques could lead to higher accuracy, they may complicate user interaction and potentially overwhelm students. The best method for validating responses after generation is an open question, and requires targeted future work. One potential approach for improving accuracy",

      "text": "an open question, and requires targeted future work. One potential approach for improving accuracy and user trust is the addition of a Sufficiency Check step similar to CodeHelp [37] before generating the final response. This sufficiency check would actively engage users in refining the AI’s understanding by prompting users about missing context or clarifying uncertainties. Moreover, future tools could enhance the validation of scaffolded responses by including code execution capabilities and enabling users to interact with and test the underlying code generated by the AI, without directly revealing it. This interaction could be facilitated through a line-by-line execution interface, similar to PythonTutor [19], and can use a black-box approach or represent a pseudo-code version. 9 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK Our findings from the deployment of CodeAid are contextualized within a second-year C programming course at a single university, which may not directly generalize to other courses and contexts. Furthermore, the perceived accuracy and utility of CodeAid, which in turn influenced students’ trust and engagement, were heavily tied to the OpenAI models we used. The initial release of CodeAid with the code-davinci-002 model from 2021 could have adversely shaped students’ perceptions, particularly when compared to the subsequently adopted gpt-3.5-turbo model from 2023. This factor might account for some of CodeAid’s inaccurate responses and the decline in student usage we",

      "text": "factor might account for some of CodeAid’s inaccurate responses and the decline in student usage we observed over time. Additionally, the performance of these models varies between different program- ming languages [ 63], or even different code-related tasks (e.g. code explanation, fixing, or generation). For future work, we plan to run longitudinal studies to investigate how using pedagogical AI coding assistants affects long-term learning outcomes, competency, self-regulation abilities, and frustration levels in educational en- vironments. More controlled studies could also be performed to directly compare these learning outcomes to the use of unrestricted LLMs like ChatGPT. Moreover, our results indicate that women used CodeAid more often than men. Future research should investigate additional demo- graphic factors and examine how this finding connects to existing research on gender effects in the use of resources like TA office hours and online discussion Q&A forums [15]. Finally, the design considerations for AI assistants in educational contexts, as discussed in this paper, require further exploration. Considering the variability of educational contexts and the evolving nature of AI technologies, additional dimensions and trade-offs might emerge.

      "text": "10 CONCLUSION This paper presents the iterative design of CodeAid, an AI-powered coding assistant equipped with guardrails to prevent it from gen- erating direct solutions in response to student queries. Instead, CodeAid provides scaffoldings, such as interactive pseudo-code, to foster engaging learning experiences. To understand how students utilize an AI-powered tutor and the broader implications of AI in scaling instructional expertise, we conducted a semester-long de- ployment of CodeAid in a programming class with 700 students. Our data collection included: (i) approximately 8,000 usages, coupled with students’ feedback on the responses’ usefulness; (ii) a thematic analysis of 1,749 usages in terms of correctness, helpfulness, and the extent of revealing direct solutions; (iii) weekly surveys and 22 semi-structured interviews with students; and (iv) a final anony- mous survey focusing on the use of ChatGPT. Additionally, we interviewed eight programming educators to gather insights on the future of AI-powered educational tools. By synthesizing results from these diverse sources, we identified four high-level design considerations, including key trade-offs, in the emerging design space of educational AI tools. It is our hope the the results from our study, along with the broader design considerations which we have discussed, will help guide the future development of AI-powered codding assistants.

Focusing on the content of their usage, what are they asking for, or trying to do? 1. Error Message Interpretation Students asking CodeAid about why their code is not working correctly, having errors, segmen- tation faults, etc. 2. Problem Source Identification Students asking CodeAid to help them identify the cause of the problem. 3. Buggy Code Resolution Students asking about how to resolve the error or bug within the provided code. 4. Explain Error Message Students asking CodeAid to explain a provided error message. Students may also include code for more context. 5. Code Execution Probes Students using CodeAid as a compiler and ask for the result or potential error when the provided code is executed. 6. Code and Conceptual Clarification A general programming question that usually has the form of \"how to do [X]?\" or\"what does [X] do?\" 7. Function Specification Queries Students asking for more information about a particular function, its usage and examples. 8. High-level Coding Guidance Students asking about the process of doing something at a high level and looking for some implementation detail. For example, \"How can I tokenize a dynamically allocated string?\" 9. Direct Code Solution Students explicitly asking for solutions for their labs or assignments (e.g., by copying part of the task description). 10.
